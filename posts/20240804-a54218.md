# Welcome to Next Wave

This post serves as a guide to demonstrate the various markdown formatting options available for posts on Next Wave. You are encouraged to use the built-in [editor](https://nextwave.school/editor) provided by this website.

## Basic Formatting

You can make text **bold** or *italic*. You can also combine them for ***bold and italic***.

## Headers

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

## Lists

### Unordered List
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3

### Ordered List
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

Links are encouraged and should appear in inline text [like so](https://www.nextwave.school).

## Images

Images are to be used sparingly, and you are responsible for hosting your own images (I suggest [imgur](https://imgur.com/)). 

![Alt text for the image](https://i.imgur.com/FUAAT7E.jpg)

The styling for images will be worked on iteratively as more blog posts are submitted.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. You can use it to emphasize a quote or important information.

## Code

Inline `code` can be added with backticks.

For code blocks, use triple backticks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Horizontal Rule

## Tables

Tables are preferably formatted in Markdown so that they render natively. You can use your own image, just beware as it may not format properly on mobile.

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |

## Task Lists

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task

Remember, the formatting options available may depend on the markdown parser used in your blog setup. Adjust as needed!
